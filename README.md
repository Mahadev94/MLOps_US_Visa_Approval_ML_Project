# US VISA APPROVAL PREDICTION:

## Project workflows explain to interviewers::
1. Problem statement
2. solution
3. Pipeline walkthrough and code explanation
4. Deployment workflow - tools

## Problem statement.
OFLC(Office of Foreign Labor Certification) gives job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications.
As In last year the count of employees were increased so OFLC needs Machine learning models to shortlist visa applicants based on their previous data.

## Solution approach with:
1. Machine learning models: ML classification algorithms
2. Deep learning models: Custom ANN with sigmoid activation Function.
### Solution Proposed with:
we will be using ML:
This model is to check if Visa get approved or not based on the given dataset.
This can be used to Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the certain criteria which influences the decision.
1. load the data from DB
2. Perform EDA and FE to select the desirable features.
3. fit the ML classification algorithm and find out which one perform better.
4. select top few models and tune hyperparameters.
5. select best model based on desired metrics.
